    m_values:
    - This is a debug tooltip.
    - A city of many names, known to most as Gandriel, Uzh'tomer, or simply 'the
      capital'. The walls of this historic city have seen many a king attempt to
      tear them down. Their distinctive black hue comes from the flames and smog
      of the Great Fire.
    - A city of the far north. Once covered in snow and ice all year round, but reduced
      to a city of mud by the Great Fire.
    - A loose association of former academics and mercenaries; they meet in the city
      of Urs. Their purpose is to train, to know, and to master.
    - Those who bear a Title of Old are seldom seen as friends, or citizens. Neither
      shunned nor welcomed, a Title Bearer walks alone with a name whose meaning
      was lost centuries ago.
